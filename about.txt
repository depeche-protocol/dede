=======================================
Depeche - An non-technical introduction
=======================================


What is it?
===========

Depeche is a protocol, not a program. Various programs can implement
the protocol, and if they do it right, they'll all coexist nicely.

The Depeche protocol is a method to send messages without needing
working internet. Both sender and recipient are anonymous and the
message content remains secret. Sounds wonderful, no? There are
drawbacks, chiefly among those is that message delivery may take
a long time. In fact, message delivery is not assured at all.

It works by having messages jump between devices of users of the
protocol, or "nodes" in protocol lingo. Each node stores a number of
messages it may forward when it comes into contact with another node.

Nodes are thought to be primarily personal computers, tablets and
smartphones due to processor power needs and available storage, but
other devices might be made to work, such as routers, smartwatches,
network storage devices etc.


What purpose does it serve?
===========================

It can serve several purposes, but primarily it's designed to be a
"replacement network" when normal networks (phone, internet) are
somehow compromised - Either by accident (earthquake, zombie
apocalypse etc.) or by deliberate action (government shutdown,
severe persecution etc.)

Due to the slow delivery times and possible non-delivery of messages
it will not compete with any current systems - for most people,
normal email will be a far better alternative in almost all cases.


Who is it for?
==============

It has been constructed with extreme redundancy in mind. This means
that a certain set of people will be initially interested:

* Military - Message forwarding even when normal communication is
        interrupted. This also extends to military organisations
        that do not control the local telecom infrastructure, such
        as in civil conflicts.

* Aid workers - Having messages reach remote locations where normal
        modes of communications have failed to penetrate. Should
        the aid workers be travelling, they can also be used as
        replacement mail-men for locals otherwise cut off from
        outside areas.

* Emergency response teams - In areas where communication has not
        yet been restored. ERTs, being mobile, can also forward
        messages between locals affected by disaster and help them
        re-establish contact or at least have proof-of-life.

* Dissidents - People opposing repressive governments who monitor
        normal channels of communication. In some instances, such
        governments have resorted to entirely shutting down
        communications infrastucture. Depeche helps counter this
        to some extent.


What is needed to run it?
=========================

The baseline is a smartphone. If you have access to one, you'll be
able to run an application that implements Depeche. As phones are
mobile, they make the ideal Depeche node - As they move around, they
may encounter many other nodes, spreading the messages far and wide.


Caveat emptor
=============

Depeche is build upon the OpenPGP standard for encrypted mail
exchange. As such, it has a strong foundation, but no software of
decent size is completely without flaw. Likewise, the clients
implementing the Depeche protocol may themselves be vulnerable to
attack. As such, engagning in activity that is actively opposed
will still carry a risk.

Depeche comes with no warranty. Should you end up serving time in
a North Korean gulag for contra revolutionary activities, the
creators of Depeche will not bust you out.
